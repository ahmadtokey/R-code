This article reveals the spatial accessibility to groceries and bakeries in Chicago that are inspected by the
department of public health in 2019. It analyzes the spatial pattern of the facilities with three types of results
(pass, fail, and conditional pass) and two types of service (grocery and bakery). This article analyzes the
spatial pattern of the food outlets, calculates the spatial accessibility from census tracts, finds therelationship of the accessibility with sociodemographic characteristics, and analyzes the sensitivity of the
relationship with different travel times. Afterward, four equity zones were identified with the comparison
of access scores to safe places (e.g., passed groceries) and unsafe places (e.g., failed groceries). Lastly,
insights are provided on how to locate the equity zones with the sociodemographic characteristics of the
census tracts.
The spatial patterns of the distribution and accessibility were discussed in the result section. The main
takeaways from the results are:
• Conditionally passed facilities have a different spatial cluster and spatial accessibility than passed
and failed facilities. So, this category should be studied with a distinct focus.
• Areas with a higher percentage of households with people below 18 and above 65 years old have
lower access to groceries (both safe and unsafe). Areas with high median income have more access
to passed groceries and less access to failed groceries (for up to 15-minute travel time). With the
increase in the unemployment rate, access to failed groceries increases, especially when people
want to travel shorter. Areas with a high rate of insured people enjoy better access to safe groceries.
• The equity regions are not dispersedly located, rather they tend to make strong and distinct clusters.
• Areas with more households with aged people (above 65) have a higher probability of being in a
food desert and under-risk region while lower probability of being in advantaged regions and
regions with choice. Areas with higher median income and low unemployment rates have a higher
probability of remaining in advantaged regions and a lower probability of remaining under risky
regions.
From the above findings, the key implication for policy is that it became evident from this analysis that
there exists social inequality of access to safe food outlets in Chicago. The identified areas should be offered
more subsidies to attract new food outlets that were passed on in other areas. Also working on the violation
reasons and raising the passing rate in deprived regions could be another way. The food deserts should be
considered with care since they lack both kinds of facilitie
